* Crate

A ~crate~ is a minimal amount of code that compiler can compile. There are two kinds of ~crates~:
- binary crates :: compile to executable programs, have to define a ~main~ function
- library crates :: provide a functionality to be shared with other crates, doesnt produce an executable, doesnt define ~main~



* Package
a ~package~ is a bundle of one or more ~crates~ that provide a set of functionalities. It contains a ~package.toml~ that describes dependencies and other metadata. It can contain any number of library crates, but at most one binary crate.
